    <h2>How to Stay Motivated</h2>
    <h5> Motivation is not a constant state but rather a dynamic one. It's natural for motivation to fluctuate over time.<br> The key to long-term success is developing habits, discipline, and a mindset that allows you to stay committed and take consistent action even when motivation is low.
    <br>Being patient with yourself and understanding that motivation can be reignited through the right strategies and actions is crucial. <br>Remember, the journey toward your goals is a marathon, not a sprint, and the commitment to consistent action is often more critical than the initial burst of motivation. </h5>
